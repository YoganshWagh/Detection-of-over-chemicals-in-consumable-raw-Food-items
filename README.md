# Detection-of-over-chemicals-in-consumable-raw-Food-items

In the era where the population is increasing exponentially and the availability of productive land is decreasing because of urbanization, the food demands are increasing day by day and to meet up those needs farmers are utilizing more and more amount of Pesticides and harmful chemicals to increase the production of Food. And this over-usage of Chemicals and Pesticides is leading to various harmful diseases in Humans that majorly including Cancer, Kidney failure, Heart attacks, and Hormonal imbalance in the body.

To, overcome this issue we are planning to detect chemicals in the food products in the initial stage itself with the help of a handy device. The user will be able to detect this while buying raw food items from the vendors. By detecting these chemicals contained in the food items at the initial stage we can avoid various health diseases. Even when these vendors will see that people are taking a step towards a healthier lifestyle then automatically while buying fresh vegetables and fruits from farmers they will buy organically developed food items only by detecting the levels of chemicals while buying themselves.

By using the latest emerging technology such as artificial intelligence we are going to develop a  gadget that includes machine learning algorithms that will make our machine more accurate and efficient. Additionally, the Internet of Things for hardware purposes in our project. Once the prototype model is accomplished then there is a further development of the Web portal for the end users which will guide the in the e-shopping of our product. For the development and deployment of the model, this proposed device has different machine learning algorithms which will integrate with different IoT devices and sensors to deploy a prototype and after that, the development of the web portal will be initiated.

Our Project domain is combination of different domains such AI, ML, IoT, and Web Technology.

To, overcome this issue we are planning to detect this chemical in the initial stage itself with the help of a handy device. The user will be able to detect this while buying raw food items from the vendors. We have summarized our objects below in short:

1) It should detect the number of chemicals in the food items precisely.
2) It will have more functionalities at an affordable price range as compared to devices available in the market.
3) It will be user-friendly, portable, and compact in size.
4) This product is a step toward sustainable development
5) It will lead users to a healthier lifestyle compared to their current sedentary lifestyle.

The science behind our Project is AI, ML, IoT, and Web Technology.

Our aim is to develop a functional prototype that will detect the percentage of Chemical content in our daily consumable food items.

It will be beneficial for the stakeholders, retailers, and majorly to the end consumers. 
Our Project aims to make the life of end users healthier and revolutionize organic methods for farming.


We have gone through various research papers related to our Project domain and consulted many of our Institute faculties and mentors.

Time duration for prototype development will be 6 Months.

Approximately our Project's estimation amount is 50,000/- and the time required for our Project is 10 - 12 Months.
